## Technical Concept

This idea is more geared towards a sort of CMS / blog experience? Publishing experience?

Potential:
  Personal blog of any kind
  Business website with rich content meant for eyeballs to consume!


### Overview of the Contents
CMS into Gatsby

Gatsby's SSR output unloaded onto Static Server layer

FarGate / Docker container that runs the CMS editing & Gatsby output


### CMS
Ghost CMS interfacing with some kind of DB for data storage
  - Ghost seems geared more towards a sort of publishing platform




### Gatsby
CMS layer's output getting rendered into Gatsby via GraphQL


### Static Server



### Docker Container / AWS FarGate?

TODO - this should be the last step to set up
