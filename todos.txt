Things I want to explore:

- More about the markup elements
- Adjusting the index file to remove the boilerplate and make the content my own
- Adding a new file for the menu component, and bundling styles with it
- What makes React less opinionated



General Design

Very museum-like. Clean lines, tasteful, smooth animation. Each section is similar to an exhibit.

Index       -- Clean & Classy   -- Paul Schuitema inspired
About       -- ibid

Portfolio   -- Industrial / Clean -- Piet Zwart inspired

Music       -- Forestry -- architecture / forest / mist

Contact     -- Mountain & Sky   -- stardew / celeste inspired



How could this be done in a way that makes sense, then?


Typeface Direction -- Rounded, semi-grotesque

Font Options:
- Barlow
- Heebo
- Nunito Sans
- Noto Sans SC
