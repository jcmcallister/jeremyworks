## Goals for Jeremy

- Learn CSS Grid with a modern, minimal layout

- Learn React & Gatsby

- Expand on these concepts and flesh the idea out into the JAMstack

- Connect personal, professional and music brands
  - day
  - night
  - contact

- Clean up my old Social Media noise and start a general content campaign. It's just me, anyhow. Shouldn't be too hard!

- Defy the simple expectations, but be playful with it!


## Design Concept

### Overview

**First pass concept ideas**
  Very museum-like. Clean lines, tasteful, smooth animation. Each section is similar to an exhibit.

  Index       -- Clean & Classy   -- Paul Schuitema inspired
  About       -- ibid

  Portfolio   -- Industrial / Clean -- Piet Zwart inspired

  Music       -- Forestry -- architecture / forest / mist

  Contact     -- Mountain & Sky   -- stardew / celeste inspired

  How could this be done in a way that makes sense, then?

### Home

The shot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1-aGkbUminQUXAyRF80NVlkSkU/view?usp=sharing

  Building visible through the trees
   - gradient overlay to give sense of distance
   - clean lines, large windows

  Stairs and a forest in the way to the building, a note of curiosity / play / proximal adventure

  **Taglines**
  - Embrace adventure
  - Sleeves rolled up
  - Ambition through adversity
  - Never lose sight
  - Persistence and forgiveness

  **Interaction synopsis:**
  - Myst-like click & transition
  - Clean transition phasing
  - Hint animations on desktop for choosing the page
  - Mobile direction: TODO
    - More direct hinting between Day/Night choices
    - Simple / Clean Nav

### Day

  This page will encompass the professional side, touching on a simple summary, work samples, resum√©

  - Image from the building looking out, wood floor, black lines
  - White type on the darker elements of the layout

-

### Night

  This page will cover off on the fun things I do. Sound samples, Soundcloud/Twitter/Instagram links, Hiking?, Rings?

  - Vector greenery layered up to look like trees
  - Greens, browns, streetlight vibe
  - Easter eggs? Video with optional sound in BG from Colorado trip?

  **Necessary Prep**
  - Go to Twitter and delete the dumbass posts, leaving only choice political ones that aren't too on the nose!
  - Start posting more basic things on Instagram/Twitter. Minimum: 1 image per week, 1 sonic post per week. Liberal hashtag usage.
